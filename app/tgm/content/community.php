            <p>COMMUNITY</p>

            <p>
                Still thinking about this.
            </p>

            <p>
                General thought is to have a SPECIAL Place on the site for Members. When someone Signs Up on the site -
                There are things on the site that are available
                to them that are not available to the public.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Community is where a few things happen ...
            </p>

            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Links (Doorways) for Signed in Members take them to Private areas/information</li>
                <li>!!Important!! The Data/information/tools behind those Doors are Private. i.e. you must SIGN IN to
                    get through the door if you are nort already SIGNED IN
                </li>
                <li>!!Equally Important!! The Doors themselves are NOT Hidden - everyone sees them. Explained below</li>
                <li>We may want to eventually create some rudimentary "Sharing" BETWEEN Community members and TGM
                    Representatives - Q & A, Forums
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                As mentioned above, all doors (links) in the community don't have to be invisible to the public, as long
                as they are access-controlled.
                What the company wants is for everyone in America that harvests grain to be a member of the TGM
                Community. But to do that, there has to be a "reason"
                to sign up. We can tell them to, but thats not enough. The community will give us opportunities to
                increase signup/participation.
                The Tool we are describing or the Report that will save you big dollars that we are discussing, etc may
                be only available to registered members.
                But we want everyone to see the descriptions and the discussions. When they cick to "Get It", thats when
                we'll let them know they aren't registered yet but then
                will give them a quick way to sign up for free so they can get that report or tool, etc.
            </p>
