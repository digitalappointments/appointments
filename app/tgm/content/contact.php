                This is Where the customer will look to find out how to get a hold of us, get support, etc.

            <p>
                We can discuss this.<br>
                Lots of Options Here.<br>

            <p>
                Service Desk ?<br>
                - place where they can categorize and then type in their questions that we have a facility to see on our
                admininistrative back end ?<br>
                - admininistrative back end could then see/respond to questions (responses sent out by email)<br>
                - advantage: we retain a history of csutomer requests/concerns/issues online by date/time along with our
                responses to them. A subsequent question may require
                context from a previous exchange<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                FAQ - Strongly Recommend This<br>
                - We want to provide good support to customers and answer all questions from new procspects <br>
                BUT ...<br>
                That doesn't mean we need to answer the same questions over and over and over again ....<br>
                Regularly filtering common questions and placing the Questions/Answers in a public FAQ can dramatically
                reduce <br>
                the number of repeat questions we are responding to ... and if we receive repeat questions for which a
                FAQ entry exists - a response can simply point them
                to that FAQ entry<br>
            </p>
